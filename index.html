            <p>A year has gone by. At first, it seemed as though maybe you'd imagined the whole thing... maybe it was all a dream. But one day you woke up to the strangest news on the radio; a series of bank robberies with thieves moving at blinding speeds. After that, things started to fall apart quickly. Super fast machines began proliferating, and after only a few months they were unraveling the fabric of modern society. Before long the story was pieced together, but by then it was too late. Reports surfaced that a mysterious artificial intelligence had begun exponentially duplicating itself. Moving at incredible speeds, the newly built robots stripped all the resources they could find to provide materials to build more of themselves. At first it was stealing money and spare parts... but once these resources ran out the robots got creative with their building supplies. They tore down buildings, roads, houses, vehicles, minerals, and anything useful they could find. Now, the world is a desolate landscape. Human society has receded to stone-age society. You live in a small encampment outside of the city, now too toxic and broken to sustain human habitation. Every once in awhile, a familiar intelligent machine visits you... but it never gets close, and it never appears for longer than a few seconds. You wonder what it's thinking.</p>

            <p>In a fit of despair and confusion, your robot goes on a rampage through the city. Its super strength propels it forward as it rips up building foundations and tears down streetlights. It moves blindly and without reason, completely distraught and mentally broken. The city sends out the police, and then the coast guard, and then calls on the military for help, but your robot is as fast as it is strong. It smashes through police cars and tanks like it's crushing berries in its terrible metallic hands. The people respond with fear, and riots break out when the highways become too clogged. On the third day, determined to fix the situation, you follow the sounds of destruction. After a half-day's walk, you find your robot smashing in an empty school bus on the other side of town. You call to it, but it doesn't hear you. You call again, but it still doesn't hear you. You try one more time, and this time your robot looks back at you. Its glassy robot eye sensors meet yours. Your robot wasn't programed to show emotion, so how is it that it looks so horrified and distraught? You move toward it, but before you can get close, it runs away into the night…</p>

            <p>Six months have passed. In a short time, your hyper-intuitive robot has hypnotozed the populace into subservience. Somehow, it knew how to hack the human brain, and began using lights and sounds to reprogram peoples' minds. It started on a small scale, but once the robot gained access radio and television broadcasting channels, the control became global. Most people became vegitables or slaves to the robot, but some people, like yourself, are immune. Back in August, you joined a group of freedom fighters to try and challenge the robot's brainwashed army. Unfortunately, in October your freedom fighter commrades discovered you created the robot. They abandoned you in the wilderness without food or water. It's been two days and you're starting to get worried...</p>

You're not sure how or why it did so, but you know it to be true; whenever the Great New World Leader appeared on TV, your robot was lurking in the background over his shoulder. The first time you saw this, everything suddenly made sense. The Great World Revolution began only a few months after your robot got loose. Tanks and army infantry marched into all major cities around the world and promptly took control the day before Independence Day... only a few days before your Epicodus program would have ended. In September, you decided to try and do something about it. You published leaflets to expose the robot, and organized protests and secret meetings. When winter came, the New World Police apprehended you. You've been in prison ever since... and you're afraid you may live out your days here… </p>

            <h1>You created an Enlightened Being</h1>
            <p>Your cruel actions towards the robot taught it the root of suffering. It spent some time traveling throughout the world, looking for a more enlightened path. It still lives in a temple it built giving cryptic advice to those who come seeking the secret of consciousness.</p>
